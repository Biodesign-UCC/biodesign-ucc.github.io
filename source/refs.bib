ABSTRACT = {As the prevalence of image-guided interventions increases, electromagnetic tracking (EMT) systems play an important role in modern patient care, as they enable real-time instrument positioning and navigation inside the human body without line-of-sight restrictions. Miniature-size inductive coils are the gold standard in clinical settings, as they provide accurate, passive sensing of the magnetic field. To compensate for their small dimensions, such sensors are designed with an elongated shape, where the coil length is usually 10 to 20 times larger than the diameter. In this article, the benefits of a field model based on the magnetic scalar potential formulation are demonstrated for EMT applications where elongated tracking sensors are used. The novel method resolves the single-point approximation error when the coil length is not negligible, and demonstrates improvements in terms of speed and storage requirements. A detailed analysis is proposed where alternative formulations of the magnetic model used in the tracking algorithm are compared. Although this work does not resolve any substantial limits of EMT used in a clinical environment, which are mainly caused by the presence of magnetic distortions, the proposed method is an improvement over existing EMT systems because it enables more accurate and faster tracking. The method might facilitate the use of longer tracking sensor coils which can achieve high sensitivities without the requirement of a magnetic core. In the envisioned application, such coils may be wound around flexible instruments, such as endoscopes or catheters.},

  abstract = {Image-guided interventions (IGT) have shown a huge potential to improve medical procedures or even allow for new treatment options. Most ultrasound(US)-based IGT systems use electromagnetic (EM) tracking for localizing US probes and instruments. However, EM tracking is not always reliable in clinical settings because the EM field can be disturbed by medical equipment. So far, most researchers used and studied commercial EM trackers with their IGT systems which in turn limited the possibilities to customize the trackers in order minimize distortions and make the systems robust for clinical use. In light of current good scientific practice initiatives that increasingly request research to publish the source code corresponding to a paper, the aim of this work was to test the feasibility of using the open-source EM tracker (Anser EMT) for localizing US probes in a clinical US suite for the first time. The standardized protocol of Hummel et al. yielded a jitter of 0.1 ± 0.1mm and a position error of 1.1 ± 0.7mm, which is comparable to 0.1 mm and 1.0 mm of a commercial NDI Aurora system. The rotation error of Anser EMT was 0.15 ± 0.16º, which is lower than at least 0:4 ºfor the commercial tracker. We consider tracked US as feasible with Anser EMT if an accuracy of 1–2 mm is sufficient for a specific application.},

  abstract = {Electromagnetic tracking (EMT) is a core platform technology in the navigation and visualisation of image-guided procedures. The technology provides high tracking accuracy in non-line-of-sight environments, allowing instrument navigation in locations where optical tracking is not feasible. Integration of EMT in complex procedures, often coupled with multi-modal imaging, is on the rise, yet the lack of flexibility in the available hardware platforms has been noted by many researchers and system designers. Advances in the field of EMT include novel methods of improving tracking system accuracy, precision and error compensation capabilities, though such system-level improvements cannot be readily incorporated in current therapy applications due to the `blackbox' nature of commercial tracking solving algorithms. This paper defines a software framework to allow novel EMT designs and improvements become part of the global design process for image-guided interventions. In an effort to standardise EMT development, we define a generalised cross-platform software framework in terms of the four system functions common to all EMT systems; acquisition, filtering, modelling and solving. The interfaces between each software component are defined in terms of their input and output data structures. An exemplary framework is implemented in the Python programming language and demonstrated with the open-source Anser EMT system. Performance metrics are gathered from both Matlab and Python implementations of Anser EMT considering the host operating system, hardware configuration and acquisition settings used. Results show indicative system latencies of 5 ms can be achieved using the framework on a Windows operating system, with decreased system performance observed on UNIX-like platforms.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a novel method of controlling an endoscopic catheter by using an automated catheter tensioning system with the objective of providing clinicians with improved manipulation capabilities within the patient. Catheters are used in many clinical procedures to provide access to the cardiopulmonary system. Control of such catheters is performed manually by the clinicians using a handle, typically actuating a single or opposing set of pull wires. Such catheters are generally actuated in a single plane, requiring the clinician to rotate the catheter handle to navigate the system. The automation system described here allows closed-loop control of a custom bronchial catheter in tandem with an electromagnetic tracking of the catheter tip and image guidance by using a 3D Slicer. An electromechanical drive train applies tension to four pull wires to steer the catheter tip, with the applied force constantly monitored through force sensing load cells. The applied tension is controlled through a PC connected joystick. An electromagnetic sensor embedded in the catheter tip enables constant real-time position tracking, whereas a working channel provides a route for endoscopic instruments. The system is demonstrated and tested in both a breathing lung model and a preclinical animal study. Navigation to predefined targets in the subject's airways by using the joystick while using virtual image guidance and electromagnetic tracking was demonstrated. Average targeting times were 29 and 10 s, respectively, for the breathing lung and live animal studies. This paper presents the first reported remote controlled bronchial working channel catheter utilizing electromagnetic tracking and has many implications for future development in endoscopic and catheter-based procedures.Copyright © 2016 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Peripheral lung nodules remain challenging for accurate localization and diagnosis. Once identified, there are many strategies for diagnosis with heterogeneous risk benefit analysis. Traditional strategies such as conventional bronchoscopy have poor performance in locating and acquiring the required tissue. Similarly, while computerized-assisted transthoracic needle biopsy is currently the favored diagnostic procedure, it is associated with complications such as pneumothorax and hemorrhage. Video-assisted thoracoscopic and open surgical biopsies are invasive, require general anesthesia and are therefore not a first-line approach. New techniques such as ultrathin bronchoscopy and image-based guidance technologies are evolving to improve the diagnosis of peripheral lung lesions. Virtual bronchoscopy and electromagnetic navigation systems are novel technologies based on assisted-computerized tomography images that guide the bronchoscopist toward the target peripheral lesion. This article provides a comprehensive review of these emerging technologies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Computed tomography (CT) helps physicians locate and diagnose pathological conditions. In some conditions, having an airway segmentation method which facilitates reconstruction of the airway from chest CT images can help hugely in the assessment of lung diseases. Many efforts have been made to develop airway segmentation algorithms, but methods are usually not optimized to be reliable across different CT scan parameters.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHODS: In this paper, we present a simple and reliable semi-automatic algorithm which can segment tracheal and bronchial anatomy using the open-source 3D Slicer platform. The method is based on a region growing approach where trachea, right and left bronchi are cropped and segmented independently using three different thresholds. The algorithm and its parameters have been optimized to be efficient across different CT scan acquisition parameters. The performance of the proposed method has been evaluated on EXACT'09 cases and local clinical cases as well as on a breathing pig lung phantom using multiple scans and changing parameters. In particular, to investigate multiple scan parameters reconstruction kernel, radiation dose and slice thickness have been considered. Volume, branch count, branch length and leakage presence have been evaluated. A new method for leakage evaluation has been developed and correlation between segmentation metrics and CT acquisition parameters has been considered.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: All the considered cases have been segmented successfully with good results in terms of leakage presence. Results on clinical data are comparable to other teams' methods, as obtained by evaluation against the EXACT09 challenge, whereas results obtained from the phantom prove the reliability of the method across multiple CT platforms and acquisition parameters. As expected, slice thickness is the parameter affecting the results the most, whereas reconstruction kernel and radiation dose seem not to particularly affect airway segmentation.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSION: The system represents the first open-source airway segmentation platform. The quantitative evaluation approach presented represents the first repeatable system evaluation tool for like-for-like comparison between different airway segmentation platforms. Results suggest that the algorithm can be considered stable across multiple CT platforms and acquisition parameters and can be considered as a starting point for the development of a complete airway segmentation algorithm.},

  abstract = {Introduction In the era of lung cancer screening, tissue acquisition of peripheral lung lesions remains a challenge. We have developed a 3D electromagnetic navigation platform with airway segmentation and virtual bronchoscopy using a open source 3D slicer environment.Methods The open source visualisation software (3D Slicer www.slicer.org) created a detailed airway segmentation and virtual bronchoscopy model from acquired CT images. A magnetic field emitter board provides tracking of a semiautomatic locatable sensor probe (SALP) in the working channel of the bronchoscopewith always-on tip tracked sensor and can be steered both manually and automaticaly with joy stick, for accurate localization of peripheral lung lesion.An extensive ex-vivo evaluation was performed in a breathing lung model that was developed using inflatable plasticized pig lungs in a negative-pressure Following this, in-vivo real time navigation in a live porcine model using a selection of novel radioopaque fiducials placed endobronchially into distal airways.Results After completion of a selection of experiments using the breathing pig lung model, fiducials were placed endobronchially in our live porcine model. Thereafter, CT images were used to create a virtual airway 3D segmentation model. After multiplaner re-construction, land mark based registration was performed to align the CT and anaesthetised porcine. Manual and automatic navigation with the bronchoscope containing the SALP was performed. The average navigation distance covered was 85.3 mm. The navigational system accurately determined 84\% of the navigation points within the airways.Conclusion Our navigational platform is inexpensive and open source and is the first to utilise SALP. In our model, there is good agreement between the position of the sensor probe during bronchoscopic navigation and as visualised in virtual bronchoscopy. Further work is being carried out to improve registration and accuracy of the navigational system before a pilot study in patients with peripheral lung nodules.},

  abstract = {Laparoscopic colectomy is the gold standard in the treatment of malignant tumours arising in the mucosa of the colon wall. The procedure is performed under general endotracheal anaesthesia and involves establishing a pneumoperitoneum with the patient in the Trendelenburg position. However this position can cause anaesthetic difﬁculties due to excess blood ﬂow to the head and neck, increased pressure on the diaphragm and increased venous pressure. In the absence of steep head-down positioning, the bowels fall or ‘‘spill’’ into the operating ﬁeld, obstructing the surgical space. The primary goal of this work is to design an atraumatic laparoscopic retractor to minimise the Trendelenburg position whilst effectively retracting the bowels from the operating ﬁeld. This work details the design, evaluation and optimisation of a novel, hand held, inﬂatable, laparoscopic retractor, through physical experimentation, computer simulation, and pre-clinical animal investigation. The optimised design for the inﬂatable retractor performs in line with simulated expectations, and was successfully tested for safety and technical feasibility in vivo in a porcine model, where the bowels were effectively removed from the operating space whilst the model remained in the supine position. These initial results represent a promising approach for the mitigation of the Trendelenburg position, whilst effectively retracting the bowels during laparoscopic colectomy, using this atraumatic, inﬂatable retractor.},

Both simulation and experimental results show the merits of each shield material. MuMetal and ferrite were found to give excellent shielding performance over a wide frequency range. The use of a ferrite and MuMetal shield is also demonstrated in a full 5 degree of freedom EM tracking system and is shown to successfully operate with position errors of 1.8 and 2.3 mm, respectively, in a volume of 25 cm × 25 cm × 25 cm. This is compared with a mean position error 67.3 mm without shielding.

Our undersampling method allows for a low sampling rate to acquire signals of interest in a range of 20-30 kHz without significant loss of precision. Lower sample rates give additional computation time between each sample, allowing for real-time demodulation without expensive high speed data acquisition and processing hardware. This also allows the use of low speed high precision analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) for sampling high frequency signals. The presented system demodulates 16 frequency components from two signals using an Arduino Due microcontroller and a two channel 16-bit ADC. The demodulated signals are then used to accurately determine the position of a magnetic sensor to within 1 mm in a volume 25 cm x 25 cm x 25 cm. The system accuracy compares well with both commercial and research systems in terms of accuracy, but at a dramatically lower cost.},

  abstract = {Background: Inadvertent dural puncture is the most significant complication associated with epidural anaesthesia. These spinal taps can result in severe and prolonged headaches for the patient and, in rare cases, serious neurological complications. The current gold standard in epidural administration involves blindly passing a needle through the spinous processes of the vertebra until loss-of-resistance (LOR) is achieved on reaching the epidural space, resulting in a subtle and sudden pressure drop at the needle tip. The LOR technique relies exclusively on subjective haptic feedback on the syringe plunger and requires significant training until a reasonable proficiency is achieved. ProDural is a novel visual syringe for signalling needle entry into the epidural space. ProDural provides both visual and haptic feedback of probe entry into the epidural space by rapid and immediate collapse of an inflatable diaphragm whilst retaining haptic feedback.
Methods: ProDural was designed based on criteria established through end user surveys, ethnographic feedback and existing technology assessment. The resulting solution was evaluated through physical benchtop experiments and analytical modelling prior to a preclinical cadaver trial.
Conclusion: These initial trials indicate that ProDural may represent a promising approach to improving the accuracy of epidural needle placement and may reduce the steep learning curve associated with epidural administration.},

  abstract = {Aim. The concept of compression alimentary anastomosis is well established. Recently, magnetic axial alignment pressures have been encompassed within such device constructs. We quantify the magnetic compression force and pressure required to successfully achieve gastrointestinal and bilioenteric anastomosis by in-depth interrogation of the reported literature. Methods. Reports of successful deployment and proof of anastomotic patency on survival were scrutinized to quantify the necessary dimensions and strengths of magnetic devices in (a) gastroenteral anastomosis in live porcine models and (b) bilioenteric anastomosis in the clinical setting. Using a calculatory tool developed for this work (magnetic force determination algorithm, MAGDA), ideal magnetic force and compression pressure were quantified from successful reports with regard to their variance by intermagnet separation. Results. Optimized ranges for both compression force and pressure were determined for successful porcine gastroenteral and clinical bilioenteric anastomoses. For gastroenteral anastomoses (porcine investigations), an optimized compression force between 2.55 and 3.57 kg at 2-mm intermagnet separation is recommended. The associated compression pressure should not exceed 60 N/cm2. Successful bilioenteric anastomoses is best clinically achieved with intermagnet compression of 18 to 31 g and associated pressures between 1 and 3.5 N/mm2 (at 2-mm intermagnet separation). Conclusion. The creation of magnetic compression anastomoses using permanent magnets demonstrates a remarkable resilience to variations in magnetic force and pressure exertion. However, inappropriate selection of compression characteristics and magnet dimensions may incur difficulties. Recommendations of this work and the availability of the free online tool (http://magda.ucc.ie/) may facilitate a factor of robustness in the design and refinement of future devices.},

Static chain formation and deflection models are described for N spheres in the presence of an external magnetic field. Analytical models are presented for the two sphere case by neglecting the effects of magnetocrystalline anisotropy while details of a numerical approach to solve a chain of N spheres are shown. The model is experimentally validated using chain deflections in 4.5mm diameter spheres in groups of 2, 3 and 4 magnets in the presence of uniform magnetic fields, neglecting gravitational effects, with good agreement between the theoretical model and experimental results. This spherical chain structure could be used as an end effector for catheters as a deflection mechanism for magnetic guidance. The spherical point contacts result in large deflections for navigation around tight corners in endoluminal minimally invasive clinical applications.}

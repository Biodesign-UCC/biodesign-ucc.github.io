Get Access
----------
GitHub is used as the primary resource for storing design files and code used within the research group. In order to access the group's private repositories:

1. Create a GitHub account on `GitHub <https://github.com>`_.
2. Email `Alex <herman.alex.jaeger@gmail.com>`_ and provide your account username.
3. You will then be added to the lab organisation within GitHub and have read access to the repositories.

Making Changes
--------------
Additions, changes and updates to the existing repositories are encouraged. Any updates to software and hardware designs can then be easily accessed by the group. In order to submit a change to a repository you should:

1. Fork the repository using through GitHub. This will create a copy of the repository in question under your own GitHub account name.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local PC.
3. Make the changes to the repository (source code edits, design file changes etc.). Ensure that any modificationw contain sufficient comments particularly in the case of source code changes.
4. Commit the changes to the repository adding a summary of your changes to the Git commit message. 
5. Submit a pull request through GitHub. This will alert the repository administrator that a change is being proposed and highlights the changes being made.
6. The administrator will review the pull request and will merge your changes into the original base repository. Everyone in the group will then be able to access your changes.
